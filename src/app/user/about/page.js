          <UITypography text="Hi, Iâ€™m Douglas Goldfein, the founder of Phoenix Sportsâ€”where kids ages 3-10 discover the magic of movement, confidence, and teamwork! After years of teaching and coaching, I created Phoenix Sports to give kids more than just sports skillsâ€”I wanted them to experience the joy of play, build lifelong confidence, and learn critical life skills through teamwork and fun challenges." />

          <UITypography text="At Phoenix Sports, itâ€™s not just about mastering the game; itâ€™s about growing minds, strong bodies, and kind hearts. With small group sizes, every child gets the attention they deserve. Our sessions build on each other, breaking sports down into simple, achievable steps tailored to every age and skill level." />

          <UITypography variant="h5" text="My Journey" />
          <UITypography text="Born and raised in Chicago, I grew up loving soccer, basketball, and baseballâ€”and cheering on the Cubs and Packers (yes, itâ€™s a thing!). My journey took me to Taiwan, where I taught English for seven years before earning my Masterâ€™s in Education. After coaching for Skyhawks Sports Academy and training coaches, I knew it was time to create something special. That dream became Phoenix Sports in Carlsbad, CAâ€”a place where kids can thrive, on and off the field." />

Our non-competitive environment ensures kids feel safe to grow, learn, and reach new milestones at their own pace." />
